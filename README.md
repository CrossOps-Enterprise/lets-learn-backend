# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINE

#### 1. Each commit should solve a single problem and be covered by a test that exemplifies that particular feature or fix.

#### 2.  Before a PR is ready for review, make sure that it is a single commit. The exception to this rule is when a PR introduces new packages. Create one extra commit in the same PR for each new package your PR needs.

#### 3.  Be sure that your PRs have descriptive titles that explain what has been changed. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

#### 4.  Be sure to connect any PR you are working on to the appropriate issue. Do this by adding `Closes #X` where X is the issue number to the PR description in Github.

#### 5. Do not mix feature changes (added functionality) with fixes (restored functionality), refactors (no change in functionality), or style changes (only whitespace or other cosmetic changes).

## Conclusion
I hope at this point you understand of how crucial it is to follow our rules. By following these simple rules you will help your teammates to review your PRs quickly and more efficiently. The chance of missing a bug is also much higher then when you have to review, for instance, a large PR or a PR which introduces different types of changes (e.g. new feature and refactoring). Let's play by the rules and you'll start to have fun very soon.
